                    I'm excited to share that I'll be embarking on a Biomedical Signal Processing project where I'll be creating a 
                    dataset of recorded phonemes. This project aims to convert speech into text by analyzing and processing biomedical 
                    signals associated with vocalizations. It's an exciting endeavor that holds the potential to enhance our understanding 
                    of speech production and open doors to various applications in healthcare and communication technology. Let's dive into 
                    this fascinating journey of data collection and signal processing!

                    It is important to note that while I have access to MRI images, I cannot share them due to confidentiality 
                    agreements with both the CSULA project and the patients. Therefore, as an alternative, I will be utilizing 
                    a black and white filtered image of my cat.

                    The research relevance is based on the notion of 3D Medical Images to grasp an internal representation of 
                    manipulating images and give a better observation tool for medical doctors. Implementing Computer Vision 
                    to MRI images allows the freedom to interpret MRI images with a 3D render applied, in this case, to the 
                    pelvic cavity. Every pelvic organ will be reconstructed with lofted ellipses identified on MRI images that 
                    constitutes the 3D volume. Applying a morphological transformation to the MRI images will result in finding 
                    the wanted organ to determine the ellipse that contours it to be used for a 3D model.
