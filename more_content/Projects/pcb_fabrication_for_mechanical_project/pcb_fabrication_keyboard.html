                    Driven by my passion for mechanical keyboards and inspired by the vibrant community on Reddit, I was 
                    impressed by the innovative ways in which members utilized the ATmega328P microcontroller chip. This 
                    ignited my desire to create a customized keyboard PCB design. My pursuit of mechanical keyboards has 
                    not only been a source of enjoyment but also a catalyst for exploring a variety of technologies 
                    including Linux, microcontrollers, and microprocessors.

                    It is noteworthy that the project made use of KiCad 6.0 in conjunction with various open source libraries 
                    consisting of footprint and IC symbols. The specific libraries employed include 
                    <a href="https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid">MX Alps Hybrid</a>,

                    The aforementioned image represents the ultimate rendition of the 3D Keyboard PCB. While it is true that many 
                    of the traces may not be ideally located and were instead placed in the most practical manner, the project was 
                    inspired by the <a href="https://mechwild.com/product/mercutio/">Mech Wild Mercutio</a> keyboard. It was intended 
                    to feature all IC components in plain view to create an aesthetically pleasing appearance for the user. However, 
                    it should be emphasized that version 1 of the project does not incorporate stabilizers for certain keys such as 
                    space, enter, backspace, and tab.
