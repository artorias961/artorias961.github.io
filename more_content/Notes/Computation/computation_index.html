                    Computation or class EE 5450 started with the introduction to Python. Where we will learn the 
                    syntax and module (library) loading system. In doing so, we will learn how to install the basic 
                    programs that will be used and understand the basics of python before focusing what is Computation.
                    First, we are going to start of by installing 
                    <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge">Miniforge</a>. Where Miniforge is a
                    conda-based Python distribution that includes a minimal set of packages necessary to run Python. It 
                    is intended to be a lightweight alternative to the full Anaconda distribution, and is a standaline distribution.
                    <br>
                    Once you have installed Miniforge completely, open Miniforge prompt input the following to create a environment:
                </p>

                <!-- Creating a tag for a code plate to input code -->

                        <p class="bash-code">
                            mamba create -n your_environment_name
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Continuing on creating a paragraph content -->
                <p>
                    Once we created the environment, we are going to open the environment by applying the following 
                    commands:
                </p>
                
                <!-- Creating a tag for a code plate to input code -->

                            mamba activate your_environment_name

                </ul>

                <!-- Continuing on creating a paragraph content -->
                <p>
                    Now we are inside the environment, we are going to install libraries by doing the following command:
                </p>

                <!-- Creating a tag for a code plate to input code -->
                <ul >

                            mamba install pandas matplotlib sklearn seaborn numpy

                </ul>

                <!-- Continuing on creating a paragraph content -->
                <p>
                    Once you have installed all the required libraries, then you will need to go to the same environment 
                    where we need to open Jupyter Lab. We do this by applying the following code:
                </p>

                <!-- Creating a tag for a code plate to input code -->
                <ul >

                <!-- Continuing on creating a paragraph content -->
                <p>
                    Now you should have everything you need for the Computation. It should be mentioned that these will be
                    my notes for future references and assuming you know Python already.

                    What is Statistics? What is Computation? How are they similar and/or different?
                    <br>
                    First, statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, 
                    interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is used to make inferences 
                    and decisions based on data.
                    <br>
                    Second, computation refers to the process of using a computer or other machine to 
                    perform mathematical calculations. It can also refer to the process of using algorithms
                    to solve problems and make decisions.
                    <br>
                    Finally, both statistics and computation involve using mathematical methods to process 
                    and analyze data, but they are typically used for different purposes. Statistics is used
                    to make inferences and draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data, 
                    whereas computation is used to perform specific calculations or solve problems.

                    Where we are able to import the following libraries and can use the following code to import
                    a CSV file which has data in it (the dataset itself is about alcohol in the blood). To read 
                    the file we then do:

                    However, we can not see what pandas has done to the code. So, we are going to check the top 
                    couple of lines of code and see columns/rows of the file. We do that by printing the previous 
                    line and gives an output:

                    PASS, and BAC. We are going to trim the datase and check the information of the trim dataset:

                    Which can be useful, now lets check the header of the file, we should see a "trim" header compare to the 
                    first header we saw. Let's rename one of the colums from PASS to FST PASS to make the dataset a lot
                    easier to read.

                    Now lets forcus at looking at the histogram since we got rid of all the useless information/data. It does
                    not appears that BAC is very distinguished between samples. However, there is a massive difference where
                    BAC is used to determine whether someone is truly legal. There is a higher proportion of subjects passing
                    the sobriety test. Let's conpute the proportions so we can see more quantitatively the difference between
                    failing a sobriety test and truly driving under the influence, and whether the original suspicions were 
                    correct:

                    It seems that indeed, the proportion of drivers pulled over by the police officers were primarily not drunk. By 
                    creating the (some_number > 0.08) condition, they are not drunk.
                    <br>
                    Now, let's compute the Z-score for the mean of the variable of officers' intuition correctly pulling over drunk 
                    drivers, to see if there is a difference between random chance and the police officers' intuition.
