                                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are popular choices for building websites
                                    and web applications for a few reasons. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                                    are the three core technologies that make up the World Wide Web, which 
                                    means that virtually all modern websites and web applications use at 
                                    least one of these languages. Furthermore, there is a large and active 
                                    community of users for each of these languages, enabling the
                                    many online resources and libraries available to help developers 
                                    create and debug their code.
